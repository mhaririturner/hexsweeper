# hexsweeper

This game is a "clone" of minesweeper, using hexagonal cells instead of square
cells. I created it as a proof of concept because I was curious if such a game
would be possible, and if so would it be interesting.

CTRL/CMD + left click to flag a cell
"R" to reset the game
CTRL/CMD + "W" to close the game
