# hexsweeper

# Information
This game is a "clone" of minesweeper, using hexagonal cells instead of square cells. I created as a proof of concept because I was curious if such a game would be possible, and if so would it be interesting.

# Gameplay
Left click to "dig" a cell
Right click to flag a cell
"R" to reset the game
Close the window to end the game

# Instructions
Run the quick start before first launch
Use "./gohex.sh" to run
